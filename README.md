# SmartQueryRouter

SmartQueryRouter is a modular, plug-and-play proxy layer designed to intelligently route queries across distributed databases. By leveraging real-time system metrics and feedback, it optimizes performance and resilience, making it suitable for various database systems such as MongoDB, Couchbase, Cassandra, and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

SmartQueryRouter aims to provide a database-agnostic routing layer that adapts to the current state of the system. It combines system metrics, historical query performance, and adaptive logic to ensure efficient query routing.

## Features

- **Database-Agnostic**: Supports multiple backend databases.
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Integrates with Prometheus for real-time monitoring.
- **Adaptive Routing**: Uses a scoring function to determine the best node for query execution.
- **Pluggable Backends**: Easily extendable to support additional databases.
- **Configurable Policies**: Allows customization of routing strategies and weights.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **Query Proxy Layer**: The main entry point for client queries.
- **Metrics Collector**: Gathers system metrics from backend nodes.
- **Routing Engine**: Determines the optimal node for query execution based on metrics and historical data.
- **Backend Adapters**: Interfaces for interacting with different database systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with SmartQueryRouter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-query-router.git
   cd smart-query-router
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Configure the application by editing `config/config.yaml`.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can send queries to the proxy server. The proxy will route the queries to the appropriate backend node based on the current system metrics and historical performance.

## Configuration

The configuration file `config/config.yaml` allows you to set various parameters, including:

- Weights for the scoring function
- Routing strategies

Example configuration:
```yaml
weights:
  cpu: 0.5
  latency: 0.3
  memory: 0.2
strategy: "least_score"
```

## Testing

Integration tests are located in the `tests/integration` directory. To run the tests, use the following command:
```
go test ./tests/integration
```
